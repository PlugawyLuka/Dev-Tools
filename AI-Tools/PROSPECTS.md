# Local LLM — Prospects (models & toolkits)

Purpose
- Short, medium-level overview of free/open LLMs and toolkits you can use locally. Each entry includes a short description, pros, cons, difficulty, and whether it is realistic to run on Raspberry Pi 4 / 5.

Notes
- “Run on Pi” marks indicate realistic local inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB preferred) or Pi 5 for moderate models when using optimized runtimes / quantization. Heavier models require a desktop or server for inference and can be served to the Pi over LAN.

1) LLaMA 2 family (7B, 13B, ...)
- Description: Meta’s open LLaMA 2 weights and many community instruction-tuned variants (Alpaca, Vicuna, etc.). Widely supported by conversion/quantization tools (ggml/llama.cpp).
- Pros: Very strong performance per parameter; many community tuned checkpoints; good ecosystem (llama.cpp, text-generation-webui).
- Cons: Larger models need conversion/quantization; licensing requires acceptance; 13B+ need lots of RAM/compute.
- Difficulty: Medium (model converts and quantization steps required).
- Run on Pi 4/5: LLaMA-7B (quantized to GGML 4-bit) — feasible on Pi 4 (8GB) and Pi 5 with slow-to-moderate latency. 13B+ — not feasible locally; use desktop server.

2) Alpaca / Vicuna (fine-tuned LLaMA variants)
- Description: Instruction-tuned LLaMA-based models that are smaller/focused for chat-like tasks.
- Pros: Good chat behavior with smaller checkpoints (7B). Easy to run via llama.cpp after conversion.
- Cons: Quality depends on training data; still require quantization for Pi.
- Difficulty: Medium.
- Run on Pi 4/5: 7B variants (quantized) — feasible. Larger variants — not realistic.

3) Mistral (7B / smaller variants)
- Description: Mistral 7B and smaller community builds with good accuracy and efficiency.
- Pros: Competitive accuracy, efficient; community support is growing.
- Cons: Newer ecosystem — conversion tooling evolving.
- Difficulty: Medium.
- Run on Pi 4/5: Mistral 7B quantized — possible on Pi 5 and Pi 4 (8GB) with slow inference; test performance first.

4) GPT-J (6B) / GPT-Neo
- Description: EleutherAI open models (GPT-J 6B, GPT-Neo).
- Pros: Fully open, useful for many tasks; GPT-J 6B fits a mid-range compute profile.
- Cons: GPT-J is decoder-only and less efficient than modern LLaMA-style models; memory still non-trivial.
- Difficulty: Medium.
- Run on Pi 4/5: GPT-J-6B — borderline; may run with heavy quantization & swap on Pi 5 but expect poor latency. Better on desktop.

5) BLOOM (BigScience)
- Description: Large multilingual model family (small->huge). Useful if multilingual support is required.
- Pros: Open, supports many languages.
- Cons: Even small BLOOM variants are heavy; large versions impractical locally.
- Difficulty: Hard (conversion + resource heavy).
- Run on Pi 4/5: Not recommended except for very small distillations; use desktop/server.

6) FLAN-T5 / T5-family (small, base, large)
- Description: Encoder‑decoder models tuned for instruction following (Flan-T5). Small sizes exist that are lightweight.
- Pros: Small variants (small/mini) are compact and fast; good for structured tasks and generation.
- Cons: For long conversational context or open-ended chat, decoder-only LLMs might be preferable.
- Difficulty: Easy–Medium (standard Hugging Face pipelines).
- Run on Pi 4/5: Small/mini Flan-T5 — feasible on Pi 4/5 with modest memory and CPU usage.

7) llama.cpp + GGML toolchain
- Description: CPU-optimized C++ runtime (ggml) that loads quantized model files and runs inference on CPU (widely used for LLaMA-style models).
- Pros: Highly optimized for CPU, supports quantized formats for small memory footprint, works on ARM (Pi).
- Cons: Requires conversion/quantization and command-line configuration; not a model itself.
- Difficulty: Medium.
- Run on Pi 4/5: Yes — this is the primary recommended runtime for Pi deployments for LLaMA-style 7B quantized models.

General recommendations / summary
- For Pi deployments aim for: small encoder-decoder models (Flan-T5 small) for structured tasks, or LLaMA-style 7B quantized models via llama.cpp for chat-like interactions. Use desktop/server for heavy models (13B+ or non-quantized 7B/6B).
- If strict offline local operation and low-cost hardware are priorities, pick VMs/tooling that support GGML/llama.cpp and plan quantized 4-bit models. If you need higher quality latency, run inference on desktop and expose a local API to the Pi.
